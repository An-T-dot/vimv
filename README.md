# vimv

vimv is a terminal-based file rename utility that lets you easily mass-rename files using Vim.

## Usage

1. Go to a directory and enter `vimv`. A Vim window will be opened with names of all files.
2. Use Vim's text editing features to edit the names of files. For example, search and replace a particular string.
3. Save and exit. Your files should be renamed now.

## Gotchas

Don't delete or swap the lines while in Vim or things will get ugly.
